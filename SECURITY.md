## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities, please report them to our security team by emailing [ihsandevs@ihsandevs.com](mailto:ihsandevs@ihsandevs.com). We appreciate your effort in responsibly disclosing any findings to us and giving us an opportunity to address them before making them public.

Please include the following details in your vulnerability report:

- A concise description of the vulnerability or issue.
- Steps to reproduce and demonstrate the vulnerability, if applicable.
- Any potential impact or exploit scenarios.
- Your name/handle and contact information (email, GitHub username, etc.) for recognition in the responsible disclosure.

We will review and respond to your report as quickly as possible. If the report is valid, we will acknowledge your contribution and work towards addressing the issue. We kindly request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had sufficient time to investigate and provide a fix.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure.
